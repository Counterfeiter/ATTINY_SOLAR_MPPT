Tiny Solar Cell Charger Atmel Studio C-Project
==============

A switched solar cell charger for LiPo batteries (4.2 V) with a 8-pin Atmel ATTINY13.
Required hardware: more information on [my blog site](https://sebastianfoerster86.wordpress.com)

Update: This Project includes also a ATTiny25 project. Because the ATTiny25 could output a 325 kHz PWM.
PB0 @ ATTiny13 is PB1 @ ATTiny25 !
